Create new folder as your working directory. Download src and package.json

if you have npm already installed. use npm install within folder where you have package.json, this will install required react dependencies and packages.

to start application on http npm start

to build npm run build

After build is done, take all files inside build folder to your web server's root folder.


Additional Notes
For now, I have response.json file that is generating response to test chat. Put this file in your public folder of web application, from where your html is served.
