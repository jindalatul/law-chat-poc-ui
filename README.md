Create new folder as your working directory. Download src and package.json

Make sure you have npm is already installed. Use npm install inside folder where you have package.json, this will install required react dependencies and packages.

to start application -  npm start

to build application - npm run build

After build is done, take all files inside build folder to your web server's root folder.

Additional Notes
For now, I have response.json file that is generating response to test chat. Put this file in your public folder of web application, from where your html is served.
